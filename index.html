    <p>My Mother, Priscilla was a dancer throughout her life. Later in life she became an RN, joined the Navy and served in the first desert war. My Father, Robert went into the Navy at the age of eighteen as a Sea Bee. He became enamored by photography and took a camera up, only to excel at this art form. Later in life he became a professional Santa Clause. They met when my Mothers, brother brought my father home while on a leave-of-absence from the military. They were married shortly thereafter...</p><br>

    <p>I am the youngest of seven by thirteen years making my oldest sister fifty-eight, they are all two years apart in age. ~ Amy, Tony, Peter, Michael, Jim, Bridget, Dominic ~ They all were heavily engaged with art, music, and sports.</p><br>

    <p> I was the only child to live in the same house throughout childhood. I was born and raised in Windsor, CO. Growing up I was prone towards sports. I was a competitive swimmer, played soccer, and also, briefly played baseball. I preferred sport and I began to skate and snowboard at a young age. I was never much of a musician. I went to many schools because my parents were alway's trying to get me ahead.</p><br>

    <p>I dropped out of High School and began courses at the local Community College which lead me to CU Denver. I began to travel the world in search of adventure, needless to say, I found it. I have been in some incredibly beautiful situations and some pretty sticky situations. I have always been attracted to the darkness because it is what has allowed for the light. The only way to better understand this is to take a bath in my blood and get to know me, homie.</p>
